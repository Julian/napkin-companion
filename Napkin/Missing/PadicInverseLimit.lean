# `Napkin.Missing` — objects the book defines but Mathlib does not (yet)

The chapters' Lean companions try to rebuild the text in Mathlib.  Where a
chapter introduces a mathematical object that Mathlib has **no** definition
for, the companion used to stop at a prose note.  Instead, the missing object
is defined here — as faithfully to the text's definition as Lean allows — so
the companion's worked models and exercises have something concrete to bite
on.

Everything in this directory is a *stopgap*.  Each definition is tagged, in
its doc-string, with a line beginning

    Not in Mathlib.

together with the upstream name to watch for.  When Mathlib gains the real
object, retire the stopgap: delete the definition here, and repoint the
chapters that `open Napkin.Missing` at the Mathlib name.  To enumerate every
outstanding stopgap:

variable {p : ℕ}

/-- The reduction `ℤ/p^{n+1} → ℤ/p^n` of the tower, as a ring homomorphism:
the map that forgets the top digit of a residue modulo `p^{n+1}`.  It is
`ZMod.castHom` applied to the divisibility `p^n ∣ p^{n+1}`.

Not in Mathlib as a standalone name; it is the specialization of
`ZMod.castHom` to consecutive prime powers.  Retire alongside
`PadicIntLim`. -/
def towerMap (p n : ℕ) : ZMod (p ^ (n + 1)) →+* ZMod (p ^ n) :=
  ZMod.castHom (pow_dvd_pow p (Nat.le_succ n)) (ZMod (p ^ n))

/-- The *compatible sequences* forming the inverse limit `lim ℤ/p^nℤ`: the
subring of the product `∏ₙ ℤ/p^nℤ` cut out by the compatibility relations
`a_{n+1} ≡ a_n (mod p^n)`, i.e. `towerMap p n (a (n+1)) = a n` for all `n`.
Because each `towerMap` is a ring homomorphism, this condition is closed
under `0`, `1`, `+`, `*`, and negation, so the compatible sequences really
do form a subring.

Not in Mathlib.  Mathlib builds `ℤ_[p]` analytically (`Padic` completion,
then the unit ball) rather than as this inverse limit; there is no
`ZMod.inverseLimit` / `PadicInt.equivInverseLimit`.  Retire this if one
lands. -/

/-- The ring `ℤ_p = lim ℤ/p^nℤ` of the text, *defined* as the inverse limit:
the subtype of the product `∏ₙ ℤ/p^nℤ` of those sequences `a` satisfying the
compatibility relations `towerMap p n (a (n+1)) = a n`.  Its ring structure is
inherited from the product, since `compatSubring` is a genuine subring.

Not in Mathlib, which takes `ℤ_[p]` to be the closed unit ball of the Cauchy
completion `ℚ_[p]` instead (see `PadicInt`).  The canonical comparison map
`PadicInt → PadicIntLim` is `ofPadicInt` below.  Retire this if Mathlib adds
the inverse-limit construction. -/

section PadicInt

variable [Fact p.Prime]

/-- The canonical comparison map `ℤ_[p] → ℤ_p` realizing Mathlib's analytic
`p`-adic integers *as* compatible sequences: it sends `x` to the family of
its residues `(PadicInt.toZModPow n x)ₙ`, which are compatible because
`PadicInt.zmod_cast_comp_toZModPow` says reducing the `(n+1)`-st residue
recovers the `n`-th.  It is a ring homomorphism, being the product of the
`toZModPow n` corestricted to the inverse limit.

Not in Mathlib.  Mathlib pins down `ℤ_[p]` by the universal property
(`PadicInt.lift`) rather than exhibiting an explicit map to a concrete
inverse-limit object, since it has no such object.  Retire alongside
`PadicIntLim`. -/
