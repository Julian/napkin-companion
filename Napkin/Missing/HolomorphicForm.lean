# `Napkin.Missing` — objects the book defines but Mathlib does not (yet)

The chapters' Lean companions try to rebuild the text in Mathlib.  Where a
chapter introduces a mathematical object that Mathlib has **no** definition
for, the companion used to stop at a prose note.  Instead, the missing object
is defined here — as faithfully to the text's definition as Lean allows — so
the companion's worked models and exercises have something concrete to bite
on.

Everything in this directory is a *stopgap*.  Each definition is tagged, in
its doc-string, with a line beginning

    Not in Mathlib.

together with the upstream name to watch for.  When Mathlib gains the real
object, retire the stopgap: delete the definition here, and repoint the
chapters that `open Napkin.Missing` at the Mathlib name.  To enumerate every
outstanding stopgap:

namespace Napkin.Missing

/-- A differential `1`-form on `ℂ`: a rule assigning to each point an
`ℝ`-linear functional on tangent vectors, i.e. a value in `ℂ →L[ℝ] ℂ`.  This
is the value type the chapter already uses; a *smooth* form is one that varies
smoothly, but the raw carrier imposes no regularity.

Not in Mathlib.  Mathlib has manifold-level derivatives (`mfderiv`) but no
library of differential forms on `ℂ` or on a Riemann surface; retire this if a
`DifferentialForm`/holomorphic-forms namespace arrives. -/
abbrev OneForm := ℂ → (ℂ →L[ℝ] ℂ)

/-- The basis `1`-form `dz`, the change in `z`: the identity `ℂ`-linear map
viewed only as an `ℝ`-linear map, `restrictScalars ℝ (id ℂ ℂ)`.  Its value on
a tangent vector `v` is `v` itself.

Not in Mathlib.  Retire alongside `OneForm`. -/
noncomputable def dz : ℂ →L[ℝ] ℂ :=
  (ContinuousLinearMap.id ℂ ℂ).restrictScalars ℝ

/-- The basis `1`-form `dz̄`, the change in `z̄`: complex conjugation
`Complex.conjCLE` regarded as an `ℝ`-linear map.  Its value on a tangent
vector `v` is `conj v`; unlike `dz`, it is *not* `ℂ`-linear.

@[simp] theorem dzbar_apply (z : ℂ) : dzbar z = starRingEnd ℂ z := rfl

/-- `dz` and `dz̄` are genuinely different `1`-forms: they already disagree on
the tangent vector `i`, where `dz i = i` but `dz̄ i = conj i = -i`. -/

/-- A form is of *type `(1, 0)`* when each value `ω p` is not merely
`ℝ`-linear but `ℂ`-linear — precisely, lies in the image of
`ContinuousLinearMap.restrictScalars ℝ`.  This is the well-definedness content
of the text's "`f(z) · dz` with no `dz̄` component": a holomorphic function
scales every direction the same amount, i.e. acts `ℂ`-linearly.

/-- `dz̄` is *not* a type `(1, 0)` form: conjugation is `ℝ`-linear but not
`ℂ`-linear, so no `ℂ`-linear `T` can have `T.restrictScalars ℝ = dz̄`.  If one
did, then `T 1 = dz̄ 1 = 1` forces `T i = i · T 1 = i`, contradicting
`dz̄ i = conj i = -i`. -/

at each point is the real Fréchet derivative `fderiv ℝ f p`, an `ℝ`-linear map
`ℂ →L[ℝ] ℂ`.  Faithful to `df = ∂f · dz + ∂̄f · dz̄`: the two Wirtinger
components are the `dz`/`dz̄` coordinates of this derivative, and `df` is
holomorphic exactly when the `dz̄` component vanishes.
